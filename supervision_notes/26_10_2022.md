Tasks for Leander:

- [ ] Discuss performance of blob tracking algorithm on synthetic data for different intermittency parameters
- [ ] start with simplest case of identical blobs, then introduce realistic distributions of blob parameters step by step
- [ ] estimate space and time resolution for synthetic data from experimental data
- [ ] start writing up physics theory
- [ ] tell supervisors when they shall read parts of the thesis
- [ ] make sure that the parameter max_blobs doesn't affect the outcome of the blob tracking algorithm
