# Task for Leander:

- [ ] Compare results of transformed on CMod data to RAFT (try to compare whether transformer find the smae blob as RAFT)
- [ ] for example show frame where both mehtods find blob and plot them as contours over the raw data/normalized data
- [ ] compare number of found blobs, sizes of found blobs
- [ ] discuss why transofrmer classifies one blob as many
- [ ] discuss why segmentation worls well but classification doesn't
- [ ] try https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.label.html (see https://github.com/uit-cosmo/xblobs/blob/master/xblobs/detect.py as an example)
- [ ] use higher sigma in multi blob analysis
