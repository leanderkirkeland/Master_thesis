# Task for Leander:

- [ ] Repear analysis with variation in blob sizes (tnree steps: constant size, slight variation in size, large variation in size)
- [ ] Same analysis with variation in blob velcocities (same here)
- [ ] Same analysis for one case where you have a lsight variation in blob sizes AND velocities
- [ ] Plot results of transformer on Cmod data
- [ ] Compare RAFT to transformer (some single frames with contours of blobs detected by both methods, histogram of blob sizes and velocities)
- [ ] Send done chapters to Odd Erik and me
- [ ] analyze blob sizes and velocities of Cmod data
